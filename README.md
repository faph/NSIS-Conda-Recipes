Conda recipes for NSIS packages
===============================

This repo contains recipes to create conda packages for NSIS, NSIS plugins and
NSIS header files.

Read [this NSIS wiki page](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Conda) for more
information on using conda with NSIS.

The actual conda packages are available on https://anaconda.org/nsis.


Can’t find your favourite NSIS plugin?
--------------------------------------

It’s quite simple to create a conda recipe for NSIS plugins, just have a look
at the examples and create a pull request with a new recipe. We will build the
recipe and publish it on the anaconda.org NSIS channel.

Alternatively, raise an issue and someone may be willing to create a recipe.
